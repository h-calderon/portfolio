# An outline
* Gambling mechanics are being normalized in videogames, most of which are accessible to minors
* As a reader, I’d like to identify where this is happening so I can protect myself. I can do this by learning where these addictive mechanics are being used and how to avoid them
 
Video games have always been a hobby of mine, for as long as I can remember. I’d even go as far as to say it runs in the family, since my parents once stayed up a whole night playing Super Mario Bros 3.

But lately, I’ve seen a worrying trend become more prevalent all around. Gambling mechanics, disguised as “loot boxes”, are extremely common in basically every game nowadays. In fact, not only are they commonly used, but they also represent a large share of the corporations’ profits.
This has been going on for long enough that its effects are noticeable. Children who got used to carelessly spending money this way are more likely to develop gambling issues long term.

As with everything that makes money, these methods are most likely here to stay. Thus, the best thing I believe we could do at the moment would be to understand the issue in depth, identify how we can best protect ourselves from these predatory business practices.

# Initial sketches

### First, a quick glance at how the gaming industry has grown in the past year with a bar chart
 
### Then a look at how its profits are divided with a stacked area chart:
 
### Then a Waffle type chart to show the low probability of actually “winning” when making these sort of purchases:
 
### Show survey results from people interviewed in studies with a stacked bar chart (in %)

### And a correlation between these practices and future gambling tendencies in users, with a scatter box plot and a correlation line
