# Portfolio
This is a public portfolio to keep practicing my data visualization skills

# About Me
Data Warehouse Architect, formerly Data Engineer and Business Intelligence Analyst. My work with data has gone through all the phases: cleaning, prepping, setting up the databases and finally, creating visualizations for various teams. Any sufficiently advanced visualization is indistinguishable from magic to an end-user.

# What I hope to learn
There are many ways to tell a story through graphic visualizations; a picture is worth a thousand words, after all. For me, Data Viz is the simplest way to display all the hard work that goes into preparing and storing the data, and it's the most effective way to make your point relatable to your audience, which is why I wish to improve my skills, both on a design and a technical level. From color theory to learning about new types of graphs, there's a lot I wish to learn and the best way to do so is by practicing.
